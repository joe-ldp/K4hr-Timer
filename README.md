# K4hr-Timer
## Usage
- Download the exe file from the releases tab
- Open it. `currentAttempt.txt` will be created in the same folder as the exe. Add this as a text source to OBS if you want an OBS overlay. There is no configurability of this file currently.
- Configure the amount of attempts you are aiming for, and the number of hours if you wish. (for shorter versions like "Icarus K1hr")
- Start resetting. When you finish a run, it will show up in the timer window and will be added to the text file.
- You can reset your current attempt with the "Reset Attempt" button.
